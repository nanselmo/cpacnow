# CPAC Now
A simple web-based app. The goals are to
* help folks identify their alderperson, and that person's stance on CPAC
* provide a script for phone calls
* provide a pre-filled email
* collect other resources for info/action around CPAC

This app has been created after consulting CAARPR but continues to be a work in progress, inviting and open to feedback and improvements.
