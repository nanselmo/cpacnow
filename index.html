          CPAC Now
        </h1>
          <p>
            One of the <a href="https://www.blacklivesmatterchicago.com/10-demands-of-blmchi/?fbclid=IwAR19JHGVU4g0IE_HIyyJ3hZvIvvH3Gi4bm4_GDdQnWGYkjBvWGR9UXCw2ik">10 demands</a>
            of Black Lives Matter Chicago is the immediate implementation of a democratically-elected
            Civilian Police Accountability Council (CPAC) to oversee the CPD.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression has been fighting for CPAC for more than 50 years.
            CPAC currently sits in front of the  public safety committee in Chicago's city council, with support from 19 alderpeople.
            The ordinance <strong>only needs 7 more alderpeople</strong> to commit to holding police accountable.
